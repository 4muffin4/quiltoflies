				<h1>This site was made and designed by someone with firsthand experience of the effects of intense compulsive lying from a partner for almost two years. Its intentions and hope is for a safe space for others who have encountered such a unique type of manipulation from a partner/loved one and to allow space for such confusing feelings that often are extremely isolating. Lying although often small for others, when done by a (often self-aware) compulsive liar can damage the mentality of its victims. Leaving them to learn to re-trust others, relearn what they thought they knew, and gain back the dignity from letting someone so close to them use them (as much as everyday).</h1></div>
